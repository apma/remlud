	<p>Assisting secured creditors is one of the mainstays of our practice. We represent several local and national banks and a national lending institution. One of our attorneys, Rick D. Lange, is a Chapter 7 Panel Bankruptcy Trustee for the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nebraska.</p>
<p>At the core of our banking and creditors' rights practice is the protection and realization of the client's private property rights. The issues occur most typically in business settings and often involve the sale, acquisition or financing of business properties and operations. Much of our work in this area involves helping the client in the planning and negotiation of contracts, and the collateralization of contractual obligation.</p>
<p>We likewise assist financial institutions in a wide scope of commercial transactions. Whether your transaction is just beginning, or you are dealing with a troubled matter, we can help.</p>
