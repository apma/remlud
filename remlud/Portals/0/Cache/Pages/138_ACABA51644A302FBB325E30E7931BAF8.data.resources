	<p>With offices just one block from the State Capitol, we are uniquely situated to represent businesses, associations and individuals before the Nebraska Legislature and other governmental bodies. Over the years, our Firm has provided effective, yet discrete, public policy advocacy and issue monitoring for major Nebraska and out-of-state interests. </p>
<h2>Nebraska Government</h2>
<p>Through our years of experience representing clients before the various state administrative agencies and regulatory boards, we have come to know the people and the processes of Nebraska government and are prepared to capitalize on this knowledge and experience for the best interests of our clients.</p>
<h2>Federal Government</h2>
<p>Under the leadership of a former chief-of-staff and legislative director to a member of the Tax Writing Ways &amp; Means Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, our attorneys represent clients on the federal level as well. This experience and access has proved invaluable in advocating legislative policy positions before the U.S. Congress and Executive Branch, for our clients with interests before our federal government.</p>
